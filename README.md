## Overview

Running and organization is one thing, getting an organization to be organized is a job in itself. The ENA Portal is a web app for keeping track of all events and announcements for an organization, displaying them, accepting requests to host and/or promote events.

Users are able to view announcements (general or event-based) without logging in. However, if they wish to submit/edit an event (editing of events they submitted), they must sign up/log in. Each event will include statuses of whether they have been approved by the admin office as a viable date to hold the event, or included in the promotional queue. 

<!-- Admins who log into the site will have a different view. They will be able to see all announcements and be able to approve or deny the request, put events on postponement with a note of details, and see/edit the announcement queue (based on the admin status).  -->

## Features

<!-- * admin panel - create (or add custom) rsvp codes to db -->
* use a config file for db security

## Data Model

The application will store Users, Announcments, and a Promotional Queue

* Users can have multiple announcements associated to them (via references)
* The Promotional Queue will contain multiple announcements (via references)

An Example User:

```js
{
  username: "candacej97",
  password: /* a password hash */,
  announcements: /* an array of references to Announcement documents */,
  userID: /* for referencing later */
}
```

An Example Announcement:

```js
{
  submitedBy: /* a reference to a User object */ ,
  name: "Heritage 2018",
  location: "United Apostolic Church" /* name or address */,
  date: "11/6/2018" /* d.toLocaleDateString() */,
  start_time: "12:00:00 PM" /* d.toLocaleTimeString() */,
  end_time: "3:00:00 PM" /* d.toLocaleTimeString() */,
  deadline: "" /* not required */ ,
  price: 20 /* not required, in USD */,
  desc: "This event celebrates the stalwarts and long-time followers of the Apostolic doctrine.",
  district_event: false,
  promo_request: true,
  promo_material: "",
  createdAt: "Mon Nov 01 2018 12:14:21 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)" /* timestamp, d.toString() */,
  editedAt: "Mon Nov 01 2018 14:49:01 GMT-0500 (Eastern Standard Time)" /* timestamp, d.toString() */,
  announcementID: /* for referencing later */
}
```

An Example Promotional Queue with Embedded Announcement:

```js
{
  announcements: [
    /* references to Announcement documents */
  ],
  createdAt: String /* timestamp */,
  editedAt: String /* timestamp */
}
```

## Research Topics

* (3 points) Perform client side form validation using custom JavaScript or JavaScript library
  * [Custom JS](src/validate.js)
  * mistakes are bound to happen when users don't know what input the db is actually looking for
  * prevent submitting a form that will be rejected by the db - [my code](src/app.js#L75)
  * errors are integrated into the DOM - [my code](src/views/announcement-add.hbs)
<!-- TODO the following -->
* (2 points) Use a CSS framework throughout your site
  * [Spectre CSS](https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre)
* (5 points) Integrate user authentication
    * I'm going to be using [Passport-Local Mongoose](https://github.com/saintedlama/passport-local-mongoose) for user authentication
